Things we should have done
- [ ] Starting with a fresh filter, do a shot and run over night to capture long lived FFâ€™s (like Tc-134 @ 210.5 KeV).
- [ ] Cold filter test with different flow patterns


Mist
- [ ] When using pure Argon in a cold filter, the observed decay rate of Xe139 was half of it's true value, but only when using pure Argon.

Observed FFs (bold means likely):
- [ ] Ba121 @ 110, 210, and 99 KeV (hl 30 s) (maybe)
- [ ] Kr-90 @ 121, 1118.69  KeV
- [ ] Unknown @ 250, 1262, 1513 KeV, hl = 4000 s
- [ ] Kr-89 @ 221 KeV
- [ ] Nb-99 @ (137.7,  97.7 KeV) hl=15 s
- [ ] Xe-137 (455 KeV)
- [ ] La-144 (397.4, 541 KeV), hl=40 (fairly likely)
- [ ] Mo-104 (69, 70 KeV), hl = 60
- [ ] Cs-140 (602 KeV)
- [ ] Cs-124 (534 KeV) hl=30 s
- [ ] Sr-94 (1427.7 KeV), hl=75 s (Note: Sticks in filter + good counts!)
- [ ] Ru91_m1  @ 393.7 and 1096 KeV  hl=7.6 s (maybe)
- [ ] Xe-140 @ 805 and 1413 KeV, hl=13 s (Note: high decay rate could be useful)


In Nickel:
- [ ] Ni62 (g, p) -> Co61 @ 67.4 KeV observed. Hl = 1.6 h
